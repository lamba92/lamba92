## 💼 Key Projects

### [Jewel](https://github.com/JetBrains/jewel)
I developed the original implementation, architecture, and DevOps for **Jewel**, a Compose for Desktop library for IntelliJ plugin development. Jewel has been adopted by Google and is used in production in Android Studio. This project modernized plugin development workflows for IntelliJ plugins.

### [Package Search](https://github.com/JetBrains/package-search-intellij-plugin)
I designed the architecture and led the development of **Package Search**, the first IntelliJ Plugin built with a modern architecture combining reactive flows, MVVM, and Compose with Jewel. It provides an efficient way to manage dependencies across JetBrains tools.

### [pinsir](https://github.com/lamba92/pinsir)
Built a face detection and recognition system using Kotlin, gRPC, and Keras. Designed for real-world usage, it combines machine learning with scalable infrastructure.
